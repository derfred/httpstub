HTTPStub
========

HTTPStub is a very simple HTTP server for use in automated integration tests. For example if you're relying on an ActiveResource in your Rails application and you want to use a live integration framework this will make it easier to run the tests in a continuous integration setup.

Example
-------

The following will stub out a success response for Person.create. (Note that you need to declare which ports to listen on beforehand):
HTTPStub.listen_on(3001)
HTTPStub.post "http://localhost:3001/people/", { :status => 201, :location => "http://localhost:3001/people/1.xml" }, <<-EOF
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
  <person>
    <id>1</id>
    <name>Joe Doe</name>
  </person>
EOF
